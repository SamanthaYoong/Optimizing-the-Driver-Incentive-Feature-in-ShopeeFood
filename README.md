#  Case Study: Optimizing the Driver Incentive Feature in ShopeeFood

##  Objective
To enhance delivery reliability and platform efficiency on **ShopeeFood Malaysia** by refining the **driver incentive feature**, aiming to:

- ✅ Improve order fulfillment rate  
- ✅ Shorten delivery time  
- ✅ Increase driver satisfaction  
- ✅ Align product decisions with data and UX feedback

---

## 📌 Problem Identified

ShopeeFood Malaysia experienced the following challenges in **Tier 2 cities**:

-  Higher order cancellations during peak hours due to unavailable riders  
-  Low driver engagement with a **flat bonus system**  
-  Declining CSAT and poor customer reviews due to **late deliveries**

---

## 📌 Research & Discovery

###  1. User Research & Stakeholder Interviews
- Conducted **10 interviews** with ShopeeFood drivers  
  - Many found bonuses **unclear** or **not time-relevant**  
- Met with **Operations & Customer Experience** teams  
  - Identified peak complaint times: **weekday lunch** & **weekend dinner**

###  2. Data Analysis
- Analyzed **3 months of order & driver data** using **Excel**  
  -  26% of cancellations occurred between **12–2 PM weekdays**  
  -  Driver availability was lowest on **Sunday dinner**  
- Benchmarked competitors like **Grab** and **Foodpanda**  
  - Their use of **dynamic incentives** influenced design choices

---

## 📌 Proposed Product Solution

**Revamped Driver Incentive Feature** to include:

1.  **Time-based dynamic bonuses** for high-demand time slots  
2.  **In-app Rider Dashboard** with:
   - Bonus slot highlights  
   - Progress tracking  
   - Real-time earnings  
3.  **Push Notifications** before peak hours to prompt engagement

---

## 📌 Execution Plan

###  1. Product Requirements & Wireframe
- Wrote a PRD including:
  - Feature specs, edge cases, and success metrics  
- Built **low-fidelity wireframes** in **Figma** for the dashboard

###  2. Cross-functional Collaboration
Worked with mock:
-  Engineers to assess feasibility  
-  Designers for layout clarity  
-  Ops to align business goals

Identified edge risk: **Driver over-saturation in urban zones**

### ✅ 3. User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
- Conducted **mock UAT** with 5 drivers  
- Feedback: *“Clearer bonuses motivated me to work harder during peak.”*
